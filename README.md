# 👋 Hi, I'm Jagdish Salgotra  
### Principal Engineer | Distributed Systems | Cloud-Native Architecture 

I’m a Principal Engineer with 15+ years of experience designing **distributed, event-driven, and cloud-native systems** at scale.  
Focused on **microservices**, **real-time analytics**, and **semantic search**, I build resilient, observable systems that empower engineering teams to move faster with confidence.

## 🧱 Featured Project – Event-Driven E-Commerce Order Fulfillment System (EDEOFS)

A **production-grade e-commerce platform** demonstrating event-driven microservices, real-time order processing, and deep observability.  
Built with **Java 25**, **Spring Boot 3.5**, **Kafka**, **Postgres**, **Redis**, and **Kubernetes**, it scales to **100K concurrent users** with **50K req/s throughput** and **99.99% uptime**.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

> “Scalability isn’t just about handling load — it’s about clarity, composability, and enabling teams to move fast without breaking things.”

- Design **observable-first systems** — metrics, traces, logs from day one.  
- Prefer **event-driven boundaries** for loose coupling and resilience.  
- Prioritize **operational simplicity** — automation over firefighting.  
- Lead by **mentoring and documenting**, not micromanaging.
